URP Compatibility
-----------------

The 'ETFX 2019.4.24f1 URP Upgrade' should work for 2019.4.24f1 and up.

To apply it to your URP project, double-click it and press Import.

-----------------

If you have invisible particles in URP, this may be because of a couple of reasons:

* Materials have Soft Particles enabled
* You are using a 2D project template
* You are using an Orthographic Camera

--

To fix this problem for 3D projects:

1. Enable Depth Texture in your SRP settings which can be found in the 'Edit/Project Settings/Graphics' menu.
2. Make sure that 'Depth Texture' on your Main Camera is enabled. 

--

To fix this problem for 2D projects (or 3D projects with Orthographic Cameras):

1. Select the materials in the asset that use the Standard Particle Shader.
2. Disable the Soft Particles toggle in the inspector.

-----------------

Keep in mind that the purpose of Soft Particles is to make particles fade out near intersections with 3D geometry, and does not work for 2D sprites.
